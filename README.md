# TailwindCSS

Lesson : 
1) Fundamentals : The basics of how to use the Tailwind css
2) Layout : You just simply use the flex or grid to active the Display property
3) Mode: We just use this dark: as the change that you want in the dark mode. And we use the dark mode  import statement which I have used the index.css. Simply we have to use the dark: and give that styling that you want to give to the dark mode.
4) Responsive: By default the media queries of the Tailwind css uses for the mobile devices meaning it is from mobile > desktop not from desktop so we just have to use that accordingly or use the max-sm instead of only sm. sm -> small
5) Resuable: We can set some predefined styling to it in index.css and Like there are 3 types like base, components and utilities. It't is simply INITIALIZE ONES AND USE IT EVERYWHERE

 For the color let's say we just use the same color on all the pages and we just need to change it for some reasons so we can use @theme and then inside we can get the predefined and use it all. Like initialize it ones and use it everywhere
 
 Base theme: Base keyword is to set the predefined styles to that specific tags like h1 tag and all and when we use the h1 the styles will also be set.

 Components theme : So Component keyword is the same but we just add some style in it and we just use it to that particular part. Let's say there are so many cards which have same height, width and border stuff, so we have to make the component and add the styles it and and when we have to make the cards we just have to add that class name to that particular div that so that we can use it and then you just have to add color's and all instead of giving the height, padding all that stuff.
